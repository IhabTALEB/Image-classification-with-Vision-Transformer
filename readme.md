# Image classification with Vision Transformer
This repository consists of image classification using Vision Transformer, the model was trained using the [Natural Images](https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images) dataset from Kaggle, in This repo you can find the code in a notebook named **Vision Transformer - image classification.ipynb**, the same notebook can be found on Google Colab by clicking on this [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/IhabTALEB/Image-classification-with-Vision-Transformer/blob/master/Vision%20Transformer%20-%20image%20classification.ipynb). 

Evaluation of the system gave **92.77%** accuracy, accuracy may also increase with more training data.

In order to run this code on Colab, you need to download your kaggle.json file from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) Webiste, save it in your Google Drive, and change the path of this file in the Section "Prepare Kaggle CLI" in the notebook.
